        This system is meant to convey Moments of Resistance of Palestinians regarding Israeli policies through images on a wall.
        One of many of these segregating policies was to build all the fa√ßades of buildings in the Old City with the costly Jerusalem Stone
        which made it impossible for many Palestinians to stay in the city, since they could not afford the stone.
        The rising discontent of the Palestinian people gave way to the first and second intifada and the graffiti that came with them.
        However, it also raised questions of identity which are being answered by an evergrowing collection of images being produced on the Separation Wall.
